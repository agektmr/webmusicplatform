## Description
This platform manages connection between each **"Custom Element Node"** (both Audio and MIDI) and UI behavior.

(**Custom Element Node**: A script set of Web Audio and Web MIDI which developed as Polymer element. )

### Good thing to use this platform
 - this platform built on top of the Web Components and [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/)
  - developers does NOT need to worry about conflict (ex. class name, id name, method name and so on)
  - easy to add Custom Element Node on your environment
  - the Custom Element Nodes runs stand alone (e.g. embed on your Web page)
